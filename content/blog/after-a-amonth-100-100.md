After my [last blog post of Google PageSpeed Insights][last-pagespeed-post],
there was a debate on Reddit about the effects of getting the full points. Now,
a month later I wanted to share the results.

To fully test out the effects of the change, I needed a website that matched a
few citerias to get a clean result for the experiment:

* The site must have existing, significant organic traffic coming from Google.
* To avoid contamination, the site:
  * Should not have any other changes than the technical ones needed to get
    100/100 in Google PageSpeed Insights for the tracking period
  * Should not have any changes made in the control period

With these criterias in mind, I just happened to have the perfect site to
perform this experiment: [My old blog][putrats].

## The test site

My old blog had not been updated in any way for over a year. So the previous
months can be confidentially used as a control data.

The site's story began a couple of years ago when I started to draw some comics
with the good old MSPaint. I used the blog only for webcomics and gained some
visibility, but it wasn't anything significant.

In September 2014, I published my [first blog post][putrats-blogpost] on the
blog about App Engine's and Amazon's differences. To my surprise, it managed to
rise on the front page of Hacker News, getting almost 5000 people to visit the
site in a week.

Since that crossed an item from my bucket list, I just left the blog to enjoy
its fame. So after the initial blog post, there has been no changes or additions
to the blog. I never even published any new webcomics.

I kind of forgot about the site for a while, only to realize that after a year
from the initial blog post, the blog had almost 800 monthly organic users coming
from google.

## The situation before

Before starting this experiment, the site had about 800 monthly users visiting
the site. To make exact measurements, here's a graph from the three previous
months before the experiment, with the months truncated to first 30 days of a
month:

![Users from three months before the experiment][users-before-experiment]

That makes an average of **792 users per 30 days** visiting the site. And
generally all of them were coming organically from Google.

Looking at the data from Google Webmaster tools, we can determine the
