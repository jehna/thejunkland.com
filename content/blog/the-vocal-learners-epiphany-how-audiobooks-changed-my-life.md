There's a saying "different strokes for different folks", and when it comes to
learning, this couldn't be truer. I recently discovered that I'm a vocal
learner, and it's been a game-changer in the way I consume information.

My journey began with a podcast called [Getting into
Infosec](https://www.gettingintoinfosec.com/) where I heard [Marcus
Carey][marcus-podcast] talk about being a vocal learner. This struck a chord
with me because I, too, read slowly and [narrate texts to myself in my
head][subvocalization]. I've dabbled with speed-reading techniques, but they
never quite worked for me because, as an audible learner, I need to "hear" the
text to retain it.

Long, intricate novels were especially challenging, as they required a faster
reading pace to keep up with the flow of the story. Reading fiction in schools
was painful. Only later in life I stumbled upon the magic of audiobooks.

Now, I know audiobooks have been around for a while, and I even tried them when
they were only available on CDs. The problem with those, though, was that you
couldn't adjust the narration speed. So, if the narrator was too slow for your
liking, you were out of luck.

Enter modern streaming services - the game-changer for vocal learners like me.
With the ability to change the narration speed, I found my sweet spot. Running
the narration at double speed allowed me to comprehend and retain the
information at a pace that worked for me. Last year I read almost 100
audiobooks, along with constant consumption of podcasts.

This revelation made me realize that schools don't teach us about the different
types of learners and how to find our unique learning styles. Whether it's
reading, listening, or comprehending, it's essential to find the tools and
methods that work best for you.

So, if you struggle with reading or retaining information, give audiobooks a
try. You might just discover that you're a vocal learner, and this simple change
could revolutionize the way you consume and retain information. Happy listening!
