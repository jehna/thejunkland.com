Failing is a big part of design process. *Fast* failing. So **how fast** could I
make a game?

Answer: **In 12 hours**. Putt-e was a personal challenge to make a full game as
fast as possible.

The first objective was to do a *fully playable game* in 6 hours, but i found
out the hard way that boolean modifiers are damn hard to implement on 3D
objects. So overall 12 hours included everything from designing to trying to
total failing to redesigning and actually succeeding.
