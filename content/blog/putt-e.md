Failing is a big part of design process. *Fast* failing. So **how fast** could I
make a game?

Answer: **In 12 hours**. Putt-e was a personal challenge from 2013 to make a
full game as fast as possible.

The first objective was to do a *fully playable game* in 6 hours, but I found
out the hard way that boolean modifiers are damn hard to implement on 3D
objects. So overall 12 hours included everything from designing to trying to
total failing to redesigning and actually succeeding.

## Try it out!
The project's code is [available on GitHub][github-link] and it is licensed
under MIT license, so you're free to pick up where I left off.

You can also [play the game][play] in the browser. It's compiled to JavaScript,
so no plug-ins required.
