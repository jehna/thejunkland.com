This site is built on top of Grunt.

## Getting Started

Install the project by running:

```
npm install
```

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.
Once you're familiar with that process, you may compile this project using:

```bash
grunt build
```

This compiles the project to `build/` folder.
